At Sourcegraph, we have a small team working hard on a new experimental feature: API docs.

In order to build awesome code search we've built a global graph of code that has a deep, semantic understanding of the underlying code - which we represent as LSIF code intelligence data. Using Sourcegraph's [LSIF code intelligence data](https://lsif.dev), we can analyze your code and generate API documentation for all of it. We've started with Go code and intend to expand to more languages as we develop this feature.

## Vision

If you develop in Go, Rust, or Zig you’re probably familiar with some sites that try to do this like [pkg.go.dev](https://pkg.go.dev), [docs.rs]([https://docs.rs](https://docs.rs)), etc. The benefit of Sourcegraph's API docs over these will in the future be:

* Surface usage examples from open source code.
* Providing a single tool that works across all code, using LSIF data to provide an experience tailored towards your languages of choice.
* Giving an amazing navigation and search experience.

## Try it (experimental)

Today, it's still in its very early stages—and only a few months into development. But you can try it out on Go code today:


- [Explore encoding/json code](https://sourcegraph.com/github.com/golang/go/-/docs/encoding/json)
- [Explore Go net/http code](https://sourcegraph.com/github.com/golang/go/-/docs/net/http)
- [Explore Sourcegraph backend code](https://sourcegraph.com/github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/-/docs/cmd/frontend/backend)

Want to try it out on your own Go repositories? Tweet [@sourcegraph](https://twitter.com/sourcegraph) with your GitHub repository name and we'll set it up for you, or [follow our documentation]([https://docs.sourcegraph.com/code_intelligence/apidocs](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/code_intelligence/apidocs)).

## Improving rapidly

Here's a little highlight of the changes we've made recently.

### On by default, for everyone

The most important announcement here is that API docs is now an on-by-default experiment for everyone! You can begin trying it out on Sourcegraph.com as well as your own Sourcegraph instance by clicking on the API docs button on any repository page:

![API Docs button](https://sourcegraphstatic.com/blog/api-docs/api-docs-button.png)


Once you click it, you'll be greeted with information about how to get started in a brand new welcome prompt we’ve added:

### Better sub-page navigation

Within a Go package, there are many sub-packages. We've improved the way we render documentation subpages so you can skip over useless directories and get right to the content (but we're still hard at work improving navigation in API docs!):

### Understands the types of symbols, and uses iconography to communicate

Due to API docs being built on code intelligence data, it understands exactly what symbols are and has detailed information about them. Whether symbols are deprecated, whether they're a function, variable, interface, etc. and the UI now communicates this information using icons:

### A deep understanding of code

We're paying attention to the small details, and really tailoring API docs to each language. We want an experience that makes sense for Go first, because here at Sourcegraph we use primarily Go and TypeScript and want to ensure we build an experience Go developers love, then we'll expand to more languages and build an experience that makes sense in the context of other languages - a tailored experience for each.

One way we've enabled this is by allowing LSIF language indexers to emit data in the way they see fit. Sourcegraph merely renders it, indexes it, and adds a nice navigation experience. For example, the Go LSIF indexer even chooses to display URL hashes in a way that makes sense specifically for Go, with a `Receiver.Method` format:

![URL hash display for Go](https://sourcegraphstatic.com/blog/api-docs/url-hash-displays.gif)

In the near future, we'll enable you to search and filter based on symbol types as well. "just show me variables", "just private and deprecated functions", etc. based on the deep understanding of the code we've built:

![Display symbol types](https://sourcegraphstatic.com/blog/api-docs/symbol-types.gif)

### Feedback widget

We know there will be a ton of feedback as things are very early in development, and so we've made it as easy as possible to give feedback from any API docs page:

![Feedback widget](https://sourcegraphstatic.com/blog/api-docs/feedback-widget.png)

You can also directly email feedback to the lead engineer [stephen@sourcegraph.com](mailto:stephen@sourcegraph.com) (that's me) or the entire team via Twitter [@sourcegraph](https://twitter.com/sourcegraph). We really want to hear what you think!
